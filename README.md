MicroPython board definition files for the CerBot

This directory contains the board definition files for
this bot: https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/403

To use:

cd micropython/stmhal/boards
git clone https://github.com/dhylands/CerBot.git CERBOT

then you can build micropython using BOARD=CERBOT

Due to the fact that micropython changes over time, its possible
that this board definition may not work with the latest micropython.

If that's the case, please let me know and I'll update it.
